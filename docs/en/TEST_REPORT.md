# Test Report for AIBot Project

---

## 1. General Statistics (as of last audit)

- **Total tests:** 110
- **Passed:** 110
- **Skipped:** 0
- **Expected failures (xfailed):** 0
- **Failed:** 0

**All critical tests pass.**

---

## 2. Coverage and Test Structure

- **All key services are covered:**
  - AIService (including DI, lazy initialization, RAG)
  - MemoryService (JSON/Redis, Sorted Set, edge-cases)
  - VectorMemoryService (Singleton, errors, integration)
  - VoiceService (Whisper, status storage in Redis)
  - WebSocketManager (DI, error handling, streaming responses)
  - MessageHandlerService (DI, background tasks, RAG)
  - ResearchService (triggers, logging)
  - Health endpoints
- **Edge-cases and errors are covered:** tests check not only successful scenarios, but also error handling, exceptions, invalid data, limit exceedance, etc.
- **Integration scenarios are covered:** interaction between services, WebSocket message handling, streaming responses, RAG functionality, data cleanup after tests.

---

## 3. Test Isolation and Stability

- **External services and dependencies (OpenAI, Redis, ChromaDB, Whisper, ffmpeg/ffprobe, WebSocket):**
  - All external calls are mocked so tests do not depend on API keys, network services, binaries, etc.
  - This ensures tests can be run in any environment (CI, locally, offline).
- **Async methods and side effects:**
  - `AsyncMock` and `MagicMock` are used to simulate async calls, so real processes (e.g., audio transcription, AI response generation) are not run.
- **File system and temp files:**
  - Temporary directories are used for JSON storage to avoid conflicts between tests.
- **WebSocket and broadcast:**
  - All message sending methods (`send_message`, `broadcast_message`) are mocked so no real network interaction is required.
- **DI and fixtures are used:**
  - All services are injected via DI, tests use fixtures for isolation and state cleanup.

---

## 4. New and Improved Tests

- Added tests for DI, lazy initialization, Singleton, RAG, edge-cases, errors, integration.
- Integration tests for health, chat API, WebSocket, including mocks and fixtures.
- Data cleanup after tests, flake fixing, CI stability.

---

## 5. Recommendations

- **Do not remove mocks for external services** â€” this is critical for CI/CD stability.
- **For integration tests** (if needed), create a separate set that runs only in the required environment.
- **Test coverage** can be further checked with pytest-cov.

---

## 6. Conclusion

- **Tests are fully isolated, stable, and cover all key scenarios.**
- **The project is ready for production and open-source in terms of testing.**
- **Report is up-to-date as of the last audit.**
